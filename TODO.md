**TODO**

This file will detail things to do in developing this program. 
This file is for me and anyone who wants to contribute, and dosen't know where to start.

**Things to do:**
1: Structure code better (add setup.py, __main.py__, etc). Structure code
    more like in this tutorial: https://stormpath.com/blog/building-simple-cli-interfaces-in-python
    (github of tutorial: https://github.com/rdegges/skele-cli). 
    And this tutorial: https://medium.com/@trstringer/the-easy-and-nice-way-to-do-cli-apps-in-python-5d9964dc950d
    
2: Comment code, make code clearer.

3: When the program (in my opinion) is ready for it try to release it in pip, maybe AUR.

4: Better wiki/help.

5: More options for password generation.

6: "true" randomness

7: More words and longer.

8: Maybe config file

The list is order by priority. The top 3 are the ones I trully want to accomplish with this program, others are extra.
