**TODO**

This file will detail things to do in developing this program. 
This file is for me and anyone who wants to contribute, and dosen't know where to start.

**Things to do:**

_1: Structure code better (add setup.py, install.sh, etc), make it into a cli application._

[x] 
    
2: Comment code, make code clearer. 
[]

3: When the program (in my opinion) is ready for it try to release it in pip, maybe AUR.Â 
[]

4: Better wiki/help. 
[]

5: More options for password generation. 
[]

6: "true" randomness 
[]

7: More words. 
[]

8: Config file  
[]

The list is order by priority. The top 3 are the ones I trully want to accomplish with this program, others are extra.
